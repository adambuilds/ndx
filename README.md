# System

Production resource budgeting and time tracking application. Developed in collaboration with Hess Ornamental Iron, an artisan metal fabrication company in York, PA. 

This commit was restored from a 2018 backup of the project. The project was originally developed from 2015-2018. First priority is modernizing the codebase and updating dependencies. Following modernization, develop integration with ClockShark, Zapier, and Microsoft 365.

Old 2018 version required manual entry of granular timesheet data. New version will automatically track time and resources from webhooks on ClockShark events, and provide a user-friendly interface for manual adjustments.
